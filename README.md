# Truncated Fourier Series Approximation

This repository contains a technical project dedicated to the application of Fourier Series in engineering. The software determines the optimal number of harmonic terms needed to approximate a periodic signal by calculating the Integral Square Error (ISE).

## Project Objective

The goal is to implement truncated Fourier Series to approximate periodic signals. Specifically, the application must calculate the minimum number of terms () required so that the approximation error remains below a defined threshold.

## Mathematical Framework

The project utilizes the Trigonometric Fourier Series (SFT) to decompose periodic functions into harmonic components.

### Fourier Series Definition

A periodic function  is represented by the following series:

```math
f(t) = a_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [a_{n} \cos(n\omega t) + b_{n} \sin(n\omega t)]

```

Where the fundamental frequency is:

```math
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}

```

### Calculation of Coefficients

The coefficients are determined using the following integrals:

```math
a_{0} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) dt

```

```math
a_{n} = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \cos(n\omega t) dt

```

```math
b_{n} = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \sin(n\omega t) dt

```

### Integral Square Error (ICE)

To truncate the series to  terms, we must calculate the energy of the signal () and the resulting error:

* **Signal Energy:**

```math
E_{f} = \int_{0}^{T} f^{2}(t) dt

```

* **ICE Calculation:**

```math
ICE(N) = E_{f} - \left\{ a_{0}^{2}T + \frac{T}{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} (a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}) \right\}

```

* **Convergence Criterion:**
The series is considered a valid approximation when:



```math
ICE(N) \le 0.02 E_{f}

```

## Test Functions

The following functions are used for documentation and performance testing:

### Function 1

```math
f_{1}(t) = \begin{cases} 0, & -2 < t < -1 \\ 1, & -1 < t < 1 \\ 0, & 1 < t < 2 \end{cases}

```

Note: For these intervals, the period is .

### Function 2

```math
f_{2}(t) = \begin{cases} 0, & -2 < t < -1 \\ t + 2, & -1 < t < 1 \\ 0, & 1 < t < 2 \end{cases}

```

Note: For these intervals, the period is .

The project evaluates these functions for  values of 3, 5, and 10 to analyze convergence speed.
